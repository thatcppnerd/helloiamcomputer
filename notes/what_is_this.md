"Hello, I am Computer" is a program intended to figure out the *exact* hardware configuration of a given machine.

Should be backwards compatible with from the latest hardware to the IBM PC, it is meant to be compatible with every computer imaginable.  

It is meant to be booted from CD-ROM or USB, this should never touch a HDD/SDD.

Could maybe also test/troubleshoot/diagnose hardware problems.

Usable programs should range between (16/32/64)-bit versions of (x86/x64/ARM)
